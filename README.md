HELLO WORLD PROGRAM

Aim-To study the basic input/output structure and basic structure of a C++ code
Apparatus-Programiz/VS code

THEORY:The hello world program uses cout function
The library needed for it (iostream) has been included in it
IOSTREAM:In C++, iostream is a header file in the C++ Standard Library that provides functionality for input and output operations. It defines objects and classes for handling input from sources like the keyboard (standard input) and output to destinations like the console (standard output).

#include(preprocessor directive)-A preprocessor directive in C++ is a special instruction that begins with a # symbol and is processed by the preprocessor before the actual compilation of the code begins. These directives tell the preprocessor to perform specific tasks, such as including files, defining macros, or conditionally compiling code. The preprocessor modifies the source code, which is then passed to the compiler.

COUT:In C++, cout is an object of the ostream class, defined in the <iostream> header, used to output data to the standard output stream, typically the console or terminal. It is part of the C++ Standard Library and is used with the << operator to print text, numbers, or other data types.

USING STANDARD NAMESPACE:In C++, the using namespace std; statement is a directive that allows you to use names (like cout, cin, string, etc.) from the std (standard) namespace without explicitly prefixing them with std::. The std namespace contains the C++ Standard Library's functions, classes, and objects, such as those defined in <iostream>, <string>, <vector>, etc.
